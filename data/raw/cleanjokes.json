They also found that is was possible to make a tasty but strong type of tea from the fur. For a while this was rather popular so they thought that perhaps an export business would bring in some much needed cash. Unfortunately the tea was not at all popular due to the presence of the fur which unlike normal tea leaves didn't fall to the bottom of the cup but remained suspended in the liquid... This of course occurred because the Koala tea of Mercy was not strained.",
