Later developed PTSD getting flashbacks from constant fear from the nazis and the murder of his entire family. 3 years later Israel was founded as a safe haven to Jews. He decided to move to there but immediately got drafted to the Israel Arab war without any training, he very quickly got shot by an Arab sniper and got buried in the olive mountain. Some of you might say it is immoral and it definitely was, but when all of your neighbors declare war on you on the first day of being a country, morality doesn't matter. Maybe Frandal's death was preventable, we will never know. Hindsight is 20/20, we must look forward and hope it doesn't happen again, to any country. If Earthland will ever form, we don't want to behold the rage of the Fireland.",
