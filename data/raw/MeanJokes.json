        "punchline": "They're best friends. One day, they hear that a faith healer is in town. Thomas tells his friend they should go and see if they can make it on stage. Fred reluctantly agrees, and they go. Even better, they get called on stage. Fred explains that he's always had tto use crutches, even as a child, while Thomas talks, with great effort, about how he's had to deal with his stutter since he could talk. The faith healer loudly proclaims that as along as they believe, they shall be healed, and leads them behind a curtain so he can pray for them. Shortly after, he reappears and hypes up the crowd, then shouts 'Fred, throw out your crutches!'. A pair of crutches come sailing across the stage, and the crowd goes wild. The faith healer then yells 'Thomas, say something!'. The reply follow quickly 'Ffffred ffffell'.",
