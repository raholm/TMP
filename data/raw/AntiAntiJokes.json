The farmer, in all his grief has had a great difficulty in coming to terms with this, and occasionally pretends she\u2019s still alive. After looking around for a bit, he notices a small door built into the ground. He has never noticed it before in he entire time he had lived here, and decided to check it out. He walked up to the door, bent over, and gave it three swift knocks. knock knock knock \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Someone from the other end replies. \u201cIt\u2019s the farmer!\u201d Thinks the farmer. After no response the farmer realizes the man on the other side of the door must not have telepathy and repeats himself, aloud this time. \u201cOh, the one with the dead wife? Come on in, it\u2019s open!\u201d The farmer opens the door and crawls through, into the ground. Inside is a fanciful pub, completely empty, save for the bartender, who the voice must\u2019ve belonged to. The farmer speaks. \u201cSir, if you don\u2019t mind could you please kill me?\u201d The bartender is shocked \u201cWhy ever would I do that?!\u201d He asked. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve just discovered that all my crops have died. I have no source of money now, and no food. To kill me now would surely be an act of kindness to prevent a slow, torturous death from starvation. In addition, as much as I hate to say, my wife has been dead for years, now, and she was the only light in my empty life. I want nothing more than to be reunited with her in heaven. What\u2019s more, this telepathy installation is giving me a tumor. Please, sir, if you\u2019re the good man I hope you are, please put a bullet through my skull.\u201d",

Unfortunately, the joke had spawned not a turd, but rather hundreds of relatively uninteresting clones of itself that rarely exceeded 20 upvotes and many of which had little or no internal logic. The subreddit was later rushed to the hospital and put on anti-anti-joke support. The mods in charge of the procedure say its condition is critical, but they are hopeful that they were able to administer a meta antiantijoke in time for the subreddit to be saved from even this obvious and devastating cancer.

Our ignorance and our love of false idols has left us as nothing more than shells of what we once were, no longer able to differ between moral and temporal, no longer able to keep ourselves from the lusts of economic pride and corporate esteem. We have done this. And we must pay our debts- or else be banished to a world of intellectual lack and forgotten heroes. Gone are the days of logic, skill, and faith. Here arrives the age of dumb luck. To truly survive, we must shirk our old habits and devote our entire existence to the cannibalistic muffin-lord, Zsasa-Viveklemon. So throw down your self-reservations and pray with me. All hail Zsasa-Viveklemon. May his top be boundless and his appetite carnivorous. Praise be... praise be... and may the world burn forever.'",
