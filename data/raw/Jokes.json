Kim, being impressed by this, gave him another chance to preform. He started composing right away, this time, his masterpiece. The time comes for him to preform, and his band absolutely blows it. Kim, once again annoyed by this, sends him to be executed once again. When asked what he'd like his last meal to be, he said \"The spiciest curry on the planet!\" So he ate the curry, sweating and eyes tearing up. He was sent to the electric chair. Kim turned it on, Sparks flew and smoke filled the room. The conductor was once again unharmed. Kim, still being impressed by this, gave the conductor one final chance to prove himself. He started conducting his song, greater than the world's ever seen. His time came to preform, and his band played out of tune and out of sync. For the last time, he was sent to be executed. When he was asked what he wanted for his last meal, he said \"the spiciest curry ever made!\" Kim responded \"No! No more spicy curries! You go straight to the chair!\" They sent him off to the chair, and Kim pulled to switch. Sparks flew and smoke filled the room, but the conductor was still unharmed. Kim, astounded, said \"What! How is this possible? You had no curry. How did you survive?\" The conductor simply replied: \"Oh, it has nothing to do with the curry. In just a horrible conductor!\"",
