Later on, he becomes a train conductor again, and lo and behold, hits another person. The court gives him the death penalty by the electric chair once more, but it still was not enough to kill him so they let him go. Then finally, the man gets a third job as a train conductor and wouldnt you fucking know it, kills another person. The courts yet again give him the electric chair and yet again, it was not enough to kill him. The officer asks the man \"How the hell are you surviving the chair after 3 times?\" The man replies \"I guess im just not a good conductor.\"",

The shift foreman told us to simply assemble the thing outside but that was impossible because there wasn't a doorframe above 8'. So we went to the stage crew foreman since the stage itself didn't look like there was much work done right now and he told us that yes, we could put it on stage but we had to make it quick. So we pulled in three carriages of bars, one carriage of bolts and one carriage of wooden footpads inside, hurled it up on stage and assembled the whole thing in less than 30 minutes, carried it backfloor to the foh and called ot a day.",

He whipped out this catalog that said \"Bird Cage Black Market\" and swept to page 17. He told me that this one cage, totally constructed of 100% stainless steel, is \"the best bird cage there is\". He informed me that if I bought it they'd ship it to my house. I figured my tax return was in, so why not? I bought it. It arrived fine, but being the chemist I am, I noticed the metal was a bit off. There was, in fact, NO NICKEL, and thus this was not a 'stainless steel' cage. Now I just have a shitty actor in my house.",
