She remained completely silent during the entire meal. When the mailman was finished with his breakfast and making his way out she handed him a dollar bill. As he was exiting the household he had to ask the woman a question. He asked \"You've only lived in the house for 10 months. Why the gratious farewell?\" The woman then responded with \"I told my husband that today was your last day as the mailman. And what should I get you? He responded with: Fuck him, give him a dollar!\" \"The breakfast was my idea.\"",

        "punchline": "This is a story about a couple who had been happily married for years. The only friction in their marriage was the husband's habit of farting loudly every morning when he awoke. The noise would wake his wife and the smell would make her eyes water and make her gasp for air. Every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping them off because it was making her sick. He told her he couldn't stop and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a doctor. She was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out. The years went by and he continued to rip them out! Then one Thanksgiving morning as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the bowl where she had put the turkey innards and neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts and a malicious thought came to her. She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling back the bed covers, she pulled back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts. Some time later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bathroom. The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good. About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his bloodstained underpants with a look of horror on his face. She bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter. He said, \"Honey, you were right. All these years you have warned me and I didn't listen to you. \"What do you mean?\" asked his wife. \"Well, you always told me that one day I would end up farting my guts out, and today it finally happened. But by the grace of God, some Vaseline, and these two fingers, I think I got them all back in.",

Mary expressed her lack of interest in most of the toys and asked the store keep if she could recommend the best dildo on the market. The shop keep, looking a bit skittish said \"mam, this isn't sold on the market, but this here box will solve all your worrys!\". Brandishing a small wooden box, the shop keep quickly places the box next to Mary and proclaimed \"this right here.....is a magic dildo!\". Mary is sceptical at first, but the shop keep, seeming sure of herself, explained how it works. \"You see mam, all you have to do is open this box and say, magic dildo my pussy. and it will immediately get to work; It takes all sorts of voice commands, and never runs out of batteries!\". Mary, thoroughly sold at this point, bought the magic dildo and rushed home to use it. She arrived home in record speed, and prepared a relaxing bubble bath as setting for her new toy. She sat the box down next to the tub, disrobes, and hoped into her bubble bath. leaning over, mary opened the box and whispers \"magic dildo my pussy\". As if by mystical forces, a dildo arised from the box, headed for her nether regions, and slide easily in, moving in rhythm like a human partner. Mary was is in ecstasy! for two hours she enjoyed her bubble bath, climaxing several times, till finally she is exhausted. \"Magic dildo stop\" sayed Mary, starting to get sore from all the attention. The voice command tho didn't seem to work, and discomfort increasing, Mary tried a slew of other impromptu voice commands to no avail. Another hour of bliss turned to agony occurs, and now Mary is freaking the fuck out, this thing won't fucking stop! She shakenly gets dressed and gets into her car, hell bent on getting to a hospital or something to get this devilish thing out of her. As she is driving she experiences an intense orgasam and swerved out of lane smack into a lamp post, and thru to the brick wall behind it. Waking to the constant throbbing of her head and privates, she discovers a police officer knocking on her window. \"Miss, are you ok, man, can I help you?\" The cop asked, worried by the pale and trembling demeanor of this woman. Mary weakly tries to describe what's going on, but only manages to mutter \"help me... There is a magic dildo trapped inside me\". The officer, in confusion, and rising impatience for these crazy mutterings of a most likely drunk driver looks Mary in the eyes and says \"magic dildo???... Magic dildo my ass!\"",

The doctor tells him the muscles at the base of his penis are broken down and that there's nothing he can do unless the man is willing to try an experimental surgery. The man asks what the surgery is. The doctor tells him they take the muscles from the base of a baby elephant's trunk, insert them in the base of his penis, and hope for the best. The man says that sounds pretty scary, but the thought of never having sex again is even scarier, so he agrees. The doctor goes ahead and performs the surgery, and about 6 weeks later gives the man the go ahead to \"try out his new equipment\". The guy takes his girlfriend out to dinner. While at dinner he starts feeling an incredible pressure in his pants. The pressure becomes unbearable and since he figures no one can see him, the man undoes his pants. As soon as his fly is down, his penis pops out of his pants, rolls across the table, grabs a dinner roll, and disappears back into his pants. His girlfriend sits in shock for a few moments, then gets a sly look on her face. She says, \"That was pretty cool! Can you do that again?\" With his eyes watering and a painful expression on his face, he answers \"Probably, but I don't know if I can fit another dinner roll up my ass!\"",
