One day, when I was waiting for the train, I noticed a homeless man standing in a corner of the subway station, muttering to himself as people passed by. He was holding out a cup and seemed to be begging ...Read Morefor spare change.\nA fat woman passed by the homeless man and I distinctly heard him say, \u201cPig.\u201d \nWow, I thought to myself. This homeless man is insulting people and he still expects them to give him money? Then a tall businessman went by and the homeless guy muttered, \u201cHuman.\u201d Human? I can\u2019t argue with that. Obviously, he was human. The next day, I arrived early at the subway station and had some time to kill, so I decided to stand close to the homeless man and listen to his strange mutterings. A thin, haggard-looking man passed in front of him and I heard the homeless guy mutter, \u201cCow.\u201d Cow? I thought. The man was much too skinny to be a cow. He looked more like a turkey or a chicken to me. A minute or so later, a fat man went by and the homeless man said, \u201cPotato.\u201d Potato? I was under the impression that he called all fat people \u201cPig\u201d. That day, at work, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the homeless man and his puzzling behavior. I kept trying to find some logic or pattern in what he was muttering. Perhaps he has some kind of psychic ability, I thought. Maybe he knows what these people were in a previous life. In Japan, many people believe in reincarnation. I observed the homeless man many times and began to think my theory was right. I often heard him calling people things like \u201cRabbit\u201d or \u201cOnion\u201d or \u201cSheep\u201d or \u201cTomato\u201d. One day, curiosity got the better of me and I decided to ask him what was going on. As I walked up to him, he looked at me and said \u201cBread.\u201d I tossed some money into his cup and asked him if he had some kind of psychic ability. The homeless man smiled and said, \u201cYes, indeed. I do have a psychic ability. It is an ability I obtained years ago. But it is not what you might expect. I can\u2019t tell the future or read minds or anything like that.\u201d \u201cThen what is your ability,\u201d I asked eagerly. \u201cThe ability is merely to know the last thing somebody ate,\u201d he said. I laughed because I realized he was right. He said \u201cBread.\u201d The last thing I had eaten for breakfast that day was toast. I walked away shaking my head. Of all the psychic abilities someone could have, that one must be the most useless. What is the hidden horror? Read Less"

He lost the shirt off his back, and had nothing left but a quarter and the second half of his round trip ticket. All he needed to do was somehow get to the airport, and then he'd be home-free. So he went out to the front of the ...Read Morecasino where there was a cab waiting. He got in and explained his situation to the cabbie. He promised to send the driver money from home. He offered him his credit card numbers, his drivers license number, his address, etc... The cabbie said, ''If you don't have fifteen dollars, get the hell out of my cab!'' So the businessman was forced to hitchhike to the airport and was barely in time to catch his flight. One year later the businessman, having worked long and hard to regain his financial success, returned to Vegas and this time he won big. Feeling pretty good about himself, he went out to the front of the casino to get a cab ride back to the airport. Well who should he see out there, at the end of a long line of cabs, but his old buddy who had refused to give him a ride when he was down on his luck. The businessman thought for a moment about how he could make the guy pay for his lack of charity, and he hit on a plan. The businessman got in the first cab in the line, ''How much for a ride to the airport,'' he asked? ''Fifteen bucks,'' came the reply. ''And how much for you to give me a blowjob on the way?'' ''What?! Get the hell out of my cab.'' The businessman got into the back of each cab in the long line and asked the same questions, with the same result. When he got to his old friend at the back of the line, he got in and asked, ''How much for a ride to the airport?'' The cabbie replied, ''Fifteen bucks.'' The businessman said, ''OK,'' and off they went. Then, as they drove slowly past the long line of cabs, the businessman gave a big smile and thumbs up sign to each of the other drivers. Read Less"

One day, when I was waiting for the train, I noticed a homeless man standing in a corner of the subway station, muttering to himself as people passed by. He was holding out a cup and seemed to be begging ...Read Morefor spare change.\nA fat woman passed by the homeless man and I distinctly heard him say, \u201cPig.\u201d \nWow, I thought to myself. This homeless man is insulting people and he still expects them to give him money? Then a tall businessman went by and the homeless guy muttered, \u201cHuman.\u201d Human? I can\u2019t argue with that. Obviously, he was human. The next day, I arrived early at the subway station and had some time to kill, so I decided to stand close to the homeless man and listen to his strange mutterings. A thin, haggard-looking man passed in front of him and I heard the homeless guy mutter, \u201cCow.\u201d Cow? I thought. The man was much too skinny to be a cow. He looked more like a turkey or a chicken to me. A minute or so later, a fat man went by and the homeless man said, \u201cPotato.\u201d Potato? I was under the impression that he called all fat people \u201cPig\u201d. That day, at work, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the homeless man and his puzzling behavior. I kept trying to find some logic or pattern in what he was muttering. Perhaps he has some kind of psychic ability, I thought. Maybe he knows what these people were in a previous life. In Japan, many people believe in reincarnation. I observed the homeless man many times and began to think my theory was right. I often heard him calling people things like \u201cRabbit\u201d or \u201cOnion\u201d or \u201cSheep\u201d or \u201cTomato\u201d. One day, curiosity got the better of me and I decided to ask him what was going on. As I walked up to him, he looked at me and said \u201cBread.\u201d I tossed some money into his cup and asked him if he had some kind of psychic ability. The homeless man smiled and said, \u201cYes, indeed. I do have a psychic ability. It is an ability I obtained years ago. But it is not what you might expect. I can\u2019t tell the future or read minds or anything like that.\u201d \u201cThen what is your ability,\u201d I asked eagerly. \u201cThe ability is merely to know the last thing somebody ate,\u201d he said. I laughed because I realized he was right. He said \u201cBread.\u201d The last thing I had eaten for breakfast that day was toast. I walked away shaking my head. Of all the psychic abilities someone could have, that one must be the most useless. What is the hidden horror? Read Less"

A few minutes later, Roy bursts in through the BACK door of the bar. He plops himself up on a bar stool, gathers his wits and belligerently orders a drink. The bartender comes over and emphatically reminds him that he is clearly drunk, will be served no drinks, and either a cab or the police will be called immediately. Roy surprisingly looks at the bartender, and in hopeless anguish, cries - \"MAAAN! How many bars do you work at!?!?! \" Read Less"

They took aspirin, ate blue cheese dressing, tuna from a can, and didn't get tested for diabetes.Then after that trauma, our baby cribs were covered with bright colored lead-...Read Morebased paints.We had no childproof lids on medicine bottles, doors or cabinets and when we rode our bikes, we had no helmets, not to mention, the risks we took hitchhiking. As children, we would ride in cars with no seat belts or air bags. Riding in the back of a pickup on a warm day was always a special treat.We drank water from the garden hose, not from a bottle. We shared one soft drink with four friends, from one bottle and no one actually died from this. We ate cupcakes, white bread and real butter and drank soda pop with sugar in it, but we weren't overweight because we were always outside playing!We would leave home in the morning and play all day, as long as we were back when the streetlights came on. No one was able to reach us all day. And we were O.K. We would spend hours building our go-carts out of scraps and then ride down the hill, only to find out we forgot the brakes. After running into the bushes a few times, we learned to solve the problem.We did not have Playstations, Nintendo's, X-boxes, no video games at all, no 99 channels on cable, no video tape movies, no surround sound, no cell phones, no personal computers, no Internet or Internet chat rooms. We had friends and we went outside and found them!We fell out of trees, got cut, broke bones and teeth and there were no lawsuits from these accidents. We ate worms and mud pies made from dirt, and the worms did not live in us forever. We were given BB guns for our 10th birthdays, made up games with sticks and tennis balls and although we were told it would happen, we did not put out anyone's eyes.We rode bikes or walked to a friend's house and knocked on the door or rang the bell, or just walked in and talked to them!Little League had tryouts and not everyone made the team. Those who didn't had to learn to deal with disappointment.The idea of a parent bailing us out if we broke the law was unheard of. They actually sided with the law!The result? This generation has produced some of the best risk-takers, problem solvers and inventors ever. The past 50 years have been an explosion of innovation and new ideas. We had freedom, failure, success and responsibility, and we learned how to deal with it all!And if you are one of the Baby Boomers, Congratulations! Read Less"

The occasion was our 15th anniversary and I ...Read Morewaslooking for a little something extra for my wife Julie.What I came across was a 100,000-volt, pocket/purse-sized taser. Theeffects of the taser were supposed to be short lived, with no long-termadverse affect on your assailant, allowing her adequate time to retreatto safety....??WAY TOO COOL!Long story short, I bought the device and brought it home. Iloaded two AAA batteries in the darn thing and pushed the button.Nothing! I was disappointed.I learned, however, that if I pushed the button AND pressed itagainst a metal surface at the same time; I'd get the blue arc ofelectricity darting back and forth between the prongs.AWESOME!!!Unfortunately, I have yet to explain to Julie what that burn spot ison the face of her microwave.Okay, so I was home alone with this new toy, thinking to myself thatit couldn't be all that bad with only two triple-A batteries, right?There I sat in my recliner, my cat Gracie looking on intently(trusting little soul) while I was reading the directions and thinkingthat I really needed to try this thing out on a flesh & blood movingtarget.I must admit I thought about zapping Gracie (for a fraction of asecond) and thought better of it. She is such a sweet cat.But, if I was going to give this thing to my wife to protectherself against a mugger, I did want some assurance that it would workas advertised.Am I wrong?So, there I sat in a pair of shorts and a tank top with my readingglasses perched delicately on the bridge of my nose, directions in onehand, and taser in another.The directions said that a one-second burst would shock anddisorient your assailant; a two-second burst was supposed to causemuscle spasms and a major loss of bodily control; a three-second burstwould purportedly make your assailant flop on the ground like a fish outof water. Any burst longer than three seconds would be wasting thebatteries.All the while I'm looking at this little device measuring about 5'long, less than 3/4 inch in circumference; pretty cute really and(loaded with two itsy, bitsy triple-A batteries) thinking to myself, 'nopossible way!'What happened next is almost beyond description, but I'll do mybest...?I'm sitting there alone, Gracie looking on with her head cocked toone side as to say, 'don't do it dipshit,' reasoning that a one secondburst from such a tiny little ole thing couldn't hurt all that bad.I decided to give myself a one second burst just for heck of it. Itouched the prongs to my naked thigh, pushed the button, and . ..HOLY MOTHER OF GOD . . . WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION . .. . WHAT THEHELL!!!I'm pretty sure Jessie Ventura ran in through the side door,picked me up in the recliner, then body slammed us both on the carpet,over and over and over again.I vaguely recall waking up on my side in the fetal position, withtears in my eyes, body soaking wet, both nipples on fire, testiclesnowhere to be found, with my left arm tucked under my body in the oddestposition, and tingling in my legs?The cat was making meowing sounds I had never heard before,clinging to a picture frame hanging above the fireplace, obviously in anattempt to avoid getting slammed by my body flopping all over the livingroom.Note: If you ever feel compelled to 'mug' yourself with a taser,one note of caution: there is no such thing as a one second burst whenyou zap yourself!You will not let go of that thing until it is dislodged from yourhand by a violent thrashing about on the floor. A three second burstwould be considered conservative?SON-OF-A-BITCH, THAT HURT LIKE HELL!!!A minute or so later (I can't be sure, as time was a relative thingat that point), I collected my wits (what little I had left), sat up andsurveyed the landscape.My bent reading glasses were on the mantel of the fireplace. Therecliner was upside down and about 8 feet or so from where it originallywas.
