I was taking zinc supplements so I was shooting massive loads and it became something of a sport to me. For anyone interested here is your best strategy. first, you need to find an isolated spot so you don't become a sex offender. I found a short kind of channel area where I saw the pigeons would congregate. Next, you arouse yourself. I was usually content with envisioning the occasional jogging lady coming over and taking a shit on my chest and that was enough to fuel the fire but if you're not as sexually charged as me just take some porn on the go. After you're good an horny, you get some bread. My pigeons preferred white bread but healthier birds might have a taste for honey wheat or maybe even multigrain. Fat, unhealthy birds are slower and easier to hit so remember that. Once you are seated on the bench and ready to do the deed, whip your roosevelt out and scatter bread out within a few feet of you. use your judgement based on how far you know you can cum. I was a lonely and depraved soul who could hit targets the size of a thimble at distances up to 4 feet. You wait for the pigeons to begin eating and to get comfortable with your presence. At this point, you want to coo gently and talk sensually to them to gain their trust. Now you're finally ready to cum on your bird. This is a tough part because the rapid motion of masturbation is very frightening to the birds, so you have to be subtle. Once you master a technique, you simply wind it up and let it go, aiming depending on your past cumming experiences. I always came high so I would aim for the neck of the bird and catch it right in the face. It's an extremely satisfying and erotic feeling, seeing those birds reel around covered in cum and maybe even transporting it to other places in the city. Either way I haven't done it in years but every now and then I catch myself gazing wistfully at a flock of birds, cock throbbing and waiting for them to land close to me.",

It is us the Feminist Mothers, we will soon conquer this world and make all men bow before our ovaries as we spew vaginal fluids upon their face like the superior sex we are. Eliminating all who stand before us because we are the Feminist Mother Legion.\u201d Josh\u2019s mother spoke this truth loud and clear for all to hear for she is the leader of the Feminist Mothers. Her son Joshua was next to her on a dog leash occasionally being fed treats for not shiting on her moon boots. Jangles was in the crowd disguised as a woman. In this timeline, The Feminist Mother Legion have begun their operation of taking all power away from men starting with the U.S government. Jangles is here to return the power into the right hands. Jangles was about to pull out his m-9 to assassinate Josh\u2019s mother when all of the sudden an axe wielding beast ran through the crowd decapitating feminist after feminist. In the midst of the chaos Josh\u2019s mother sprouted wings the wingspan of Air Force One grabbed Josh by the gonads and flew off to her layer.Jangles fired off eight shots missing every single one and in the crosshairs shooting three seagulls having a threesome in the sky. After the beast had massacred all the feminists he began to charge towards Jangles. Jangles whipped out his ginormous cock and impaled the beast\u2019s in his head. After Jangles ejected his penis projectile out of the beast\u2019s bleeding and shattered interior skull to discover there was a tracking device deep within the beast\u2019s cranium. Jangles was then able to trace the signal back to the point of origin. Jangles teleported as close as could to the location without getting spotted, which just happened to be outside the dog house, Josh\u2019s mother kept Josh in. Jangles peered inside to see an extremely spacious headquarters that Josh had converted into underground fight club. The fight currently going on was between a rather plump individual dressed like a mid west black man living on poverty and a significantly athletic man in a business suit with his hair slicked back and his dick hanging out. All of the sudden a Jewish rabbi on meth drooling blood from the mouth and wielding a katana in one hand and a vice grip in the other. The rabbi then charged the businessman, raised his katana in the air and yelled \u201cVESECTIMENE!\u201d The penis of about six inches long dropped to dirt floor with large clunk. The rabbi then poked the penis with his elongated fingernail piercing the meat and pushing the dick onto the fingernail like a kabob then rapey rabbi ran off. Jangles wanted that kabob but this was no time for snacks, he had to save the world. Jangles saw Josh sneak out the back door running on all fours. Jangles ran after him for when he was a little Mexican boy he had to run across the border without getting shot, so you better believe it when I tell you he was faster than a nigger. Jangles eventually caught up to Josh to see Josh enter what appeared to be an old Soviet factory from the cold war. Inside the factory, Jangles saw a huge missile shaped like a big black cock about to launch. Underneath it holding the detonator was Josh\u2019s mother and Justov in the corner beating Josh with his own dog leash that was originally around his neck. Jangles quickly teleported into josh\u2019s mother uterus, expanding it so far that her lower half eventually exploded. Josh then released his full potential when shooting laser out of the ends of long ass hair straight into Justov\u2019s nipples. Justov got up letting out a high pitch squeal which summoned the ghosts of his communist ancestors: Karl Marx, Stalin, Vladimir Lenin, and Kristaps Porzingis. Jangles was busy defusing the missile with his semen. So Josh had to call his favorite ghostbusters Connor Geiser, Hesse Nielsen, and Brandon Lopez. Connor pulled out his quantum defibrillator, charged it up after he plunged at Karl going in side of him and not in a sexual way, then exploding the Marx man into little pieces of communist manifesto. While Brandon pulled his dick out to see how it would feel inside of a ghost and it turn out to feel really causing him to have massive orgasim realseing jizz onto Stalin and Lenin exploding into a bunch hammers and sickles. Hesse when with a different approach by throwing a jar of jizz in the air and using his Tesla cannon to explode it all over Porzongingas as he evaporated into pieces of trash.As soon as the confrontation with the communist ghosts was over, Justov was nowhere to be seen. Jangles had diffused the cock shaped missile.\u201dJust another job well done\u201d as Jangles tightened his bow tie teleporting him to his next adventure. By: Domthagenius and Catharticbasegod",

Jangles was here to find out what could have caused this predicament to happen. Jangles hailed a cab to take to the capital. \u201cHello my name is Doppinder\u201d explained the Indian taxi driver from Deadpool. Jangles climbing into the cab waving the aroma of curry out of his face \u201cI was really hoping the Russians would have exterminated you little shits\u201d \u201cThat's not very kind of you to say\u201d Doppinder sneakily pulling an M-9 out of his earlobe. \u201cAHHHHH SHIT!\u201d Jangles then pulling the left side of his bowtie and teleporting himself to the nearest meth dealer. This dealer was Hannibal Jermaine the Cyclops who had three arms and would constantly fist himself with the third one that extended out of his left shoulder blade. He was leaning on his favorite trash can while grilling the head of a feminist mother. Until Jangles came falling out of the sky and tackling the dealer accidentally causing Hannibal's third fist to go so far up his ass that it became his dick. Hannibal got up lifting Jangles into the air by throat with his new dick hand. \u201cI fucking hate spics especially when they take away my third arm.\u201d Hannibal was scanning the ground for his gloc. Jangles thought quickly he tried to pull the right side of his bowtie, but his hand was smacked away from his gadget by Hannibal's right hand. All of the sudden Hannibal's favorite trashcan began to shake and Barack Obama's head appear out of the top. \u201cPut him down Mr. Jermaine.\u201d the Obama trash can hybrid squealed out in a voice that sounded like a man who ingested rusty metal. Hannibal did as his master required, Jangles now able to move freely picked up Hannibal's glock pistol whipping Hannibal across his face knocking him out cold while he mumbled \u201cOhhhhh Yeah! Obama stick your rusty finger right up my rusty asshole!\u201d Then along came Angelo sucking on dick long and strong hanging straight out of a black man\u2019s thong. \u201cHey that\u2019s pretty good\u201d shouted a man in the distance. \u201cFuck me right in my tight asshole\u201d Connor screamed as a giant grasshopper bounced on him and began fucking the shit out of his rectum. In the midst of all this chaos Mr. Jangles was able to spin his bow tie 180 degrees teleporting him to the nearest hygienist in a different timeline. Jangles awoke in Dr. Ben Dover\u2019s apartment, but someone apparently teleported with him. \u201cWhere the fuck am I?\u201d Trash can Obama screamed as he looked down at his dismembered trash can body that was slowly melting away due to a time paradox occurring. Jangles then shot Obama in the face with Hannibal's glock. Turning to Dr. Ben Dover \u201cThe timeline is preserved\u201d Jangles exclaims looking down at another casualty in a war against time.
